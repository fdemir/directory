# Directory

Directory is a small application to list some applications or items in a categorized and simple way. It is suitable for internal and public usage.

## Technology

Directory is a full-stack application, built with the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Drizzle](https://drizzle.dev/)

## Submiting

Everyone can submit a new item to the directory category. But It needs to be validated before its public. You can accept the submissions manually.

### Why submissions need to be validated?

The main reason is to prevent spam and inappropriate content. Also, it is a good way to keep the directory clean and useful.
